## About Me

I earned an MSc in Biochemical Physics and a PhD in Biophysics from Lomonosov Moscow State University. Since 2004 I’ve been on a mission to make Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) modeling as intuitive and scalable as modern software engineering.

Today, as Co‑founder and Technology Director at [**InSysBio CY Ltd**](https://insysbio.com), I drive the creation of next‑generation modeling platforms that empower scientists to iterate, collaborate, and make data‑backed decisions across the drug‑development lifecycle.

## What I Do

| Domain | How I Add Value |
| --- | --- |
| **QSP & PBPK Modeling** | Build and validate large‑scale mechanistic models that translate biology into clinical insight. |
| **Data‑Driven Decision Support** | Combine virtual populations, sensitivity analysis and identifiability workflows to quantify uncertainty and derisk R&D. |
| **Software Engineering** | Architect cloud‑native simulation engines and domain‑specific languages that scale with model complexity. |
| **Infrastructure** | Design and secure global computing infrastructure—from collaboration tooling to HPC cluster  that keeps our distributed team productive and data safe. |
| **Team Leadership** | Grow and mentor cross‑functional teams of scientists and engineers to ship production‑grade modeling tools. |

## Flagship Software Projects

- [**Heta Language & Heta Compiler**](https://hetalang.github.io/#/) — Domain‑specific language + build pipeline for large‑scale QSP models.  
- [**HetaSimulator.jl**](https://github.com/hetalang/HetaSimulator.jl) — Julia‑powered engine for distributed simulations and parameter estimation.  
- [**LikelihoodProfiler.jl**](https://github.com/insysbio/LikelihoodProfiler.jl) — Toolkit for practical identifiability and confidence interval estimation.  
- [**Immune Response Template**](https://irt.insysbio.com/) — Modular QSP platform of the human immune system for fast-model building.  
- [**SbmlViewer**](https://sv.insysbio.com/) — Web apps that turn SBML files into interactive human‑readable forms, enabling easy sharing and collaboration.
